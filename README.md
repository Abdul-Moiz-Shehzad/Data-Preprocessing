# Data-Preprocessing
In this project, you will apply various preprocessing steps covered in the course to each input dimension. This includes tasks such as filling in missing values, handling duplicates, and addressing outliers. A detailed table will be completed for all input dimensions, documenting the specific preprocessing techniques applied.
